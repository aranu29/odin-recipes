    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        Warm, fluffy, and naturally sweet â€” these blueberry baked oats offer a 
        cozy breakfast treat with bursts of juicy berries in every bite. Lightly 
        spiced with cinnamon and vanilla, they bake to a golden finish and paired 
        perfectly with a drizzle of honey or a splash of milk.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <em>Note: these are ingredients for 1 serving</em>
    <p> 
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup high-protein cottage cheese</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon agave syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vanilla bean paste</li>
            <li>1 cup quick oats</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar-free cheesecake pudding mix</li>
            <li>1 cup blueberries, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). 
                Spray 4 (6 to 8 ounce) oven-proof glass dishes with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile combine cottage cheese, eggs, agave syrup, vanilla, oats, 
                baking powder, and pudding mix in the jar of a high powered blender. 
                Blend on high for 1 minute. Divide batter evenly between prepared dishes. 
                Sprinkle blueberries on top. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 25 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
